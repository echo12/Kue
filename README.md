Kue
===

Kue is a system that helps users remember to take all their important belongings with them at all times.
It uses RF technology to tag and detect the items, and an Android app for the user to interface with the system.
The app lists all the tagged items, allows the user to turn on/off the notification for each item, and rename the item as desired.
